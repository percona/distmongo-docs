Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a freely available MongoDB database alternative, giving you a single solution that combines enterprise components from the open source community, designed and tested to work together. The aim of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is to enable you to run and operate your

|pdmdb| includes the following components:

* |PSMDB| is a fully compatible open source, drop-in replacement
  for MongoDB.

  consistent backups of |mongodb| sharded clusters and replica sets.

This release of |pdmdb| is based on `Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.8-9 <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/4.4/release_notes/4.4.8-9.html>`_ and `Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.6.0 <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-backup-mongodb/release-notes/1.6.0.html>`_.
