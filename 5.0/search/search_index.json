Release Highlights \u00b6 This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes bug fixes and improvements provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB. It specifically includes multiple fixes related to sharding and the resharding operation. Fixed the issue with bad projection created during dependency analysis due to string order assumption. It resulted in the PathCollision error. The issue is fixed by improving dependency analysis for projections by folding dependencies into ancestor dependencies where possible. Fixed the deadlock situation in cross shard transactions that could occur when the FCV (Feature Compatibility Version) was set after the \u201cprepared\u201d state of the transactions. That ended up with both the the setFCV thread and the TransactionCoordinator hung. This is a v6.0 backport fix to v5.0 that disables opportunistic read targeting (except for specified hedged reads) in order to prevent possible performance problems associated with uneven read distribution across the secondaries. Backported the check for user errors in case deadline on the migration destination manager is hit while waiting for a range to be cleared up. This prevents the balancer from getting blocked. Fixed the situation where the shards may skip certain steps in the resharding process but respond to the resharding coordinator as if they had. This can cause the resharding coordinator to continue to wait for updated states in the config.reshardingOperations document on the primary config server and stall indefinitely. Fixed the potential for the range deleter to wait unnecessarily during concurrent migrations between batches. Fixed the issue where 2 very different measurements (one in the past and one in future) could be incorrectly included in the same buckettime-series bucket. Resolved potential problem when adding or removing shards and incorrectly gossiping a new topology time without it being majorly committed. Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.8.1 improvements include the following: Fixed the restore failure on a different cluster. Now the UUID of users and system collections are not preserved when replaying the oplog. The Point-in-Time recovery chunks display is now consistent in both pbm status and pbm list outputs Packaging Notes \u00b6 Debian 9 (\u201cStretch\u201d) is no longer supported.

This change serves to improve the user experience with Percona Server for MongoDB as the option names and behavior are similar to those of MongoDB Enterprise. However, if data-at-rest encryption using KMIP is configured, it is the breaking change because the standard upgrade procedure does not work. We do recommend to use the data-at-rest encryption using the KMIP protocol only for testing purposes until it is in the general availability stage. If you have configured data at rest encryption and it is absolutely necessary to upgrade your MongoDB instance, see the upgrade instructions .

Improved handling of large/NaN (Not a Number) values for text index and geo index version. Prevented potential server crash or lost writes when a resharding retry happens after the primary node failover. This is fixed by refreshing the routing information on the primary node during resharding. Prevented rollback to stable operation to generate wrong updates/tombstones by always reading the cell time window information to decide the history store update visibility. Fixed memory leak in update restore eviction. Failed chunk migrations can lead to recipient shard having different config.transactions records between primaries and secondaries - inconsistent data. Fixed the issue when resharding a collection with a very large number of zones configured may have stalled on config server primary indefinitely.

Updated exit code and status message during the master key rotation improves the user experience while using data-at-rest encryption with KMIP. Detected and resolved table logging inconsistencies for WiredTiger tables at startup Prevented the server from hanging in chunk migration when a step-down occurs. Fixed the issue with incorrect chunk size comparison during split by preventing the AutoSplitVector from using the clientReadable. Fixed the logger deadlock by adding a check against recursive logging Fixed the global time window state before performing the rollback to stable operation by updating the pinned timestamp as part of the transaction setup. Fixed the issue that could lead to data inconsistency by introducing the additional validation of field types for shard key patterns. Users should not modify the type (hashed or range) for the existing shard key fields Fixed the issue with failing resharding operation by introducing the start and end time metrics for resharding recipient Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.1 improvements include the following: The support of server-side encryption with customer-provided keys managed on the customer side (SSE-C) enables you to use the S3-compatible storage of your choice thus preventing the vendor lock-in and saving your costs on AWS KMS (Key Management Service). The ability to configure Percona Backup for MongoDB remotely simplifies its management when Percona Backup for MongoDB is deployed in Docker, Kubernetes or other cloud services. The ability to configure the sidecar mode for Percona Backup for MongoDB improves its operation as part of Kubernetes Operator for MongoDB .

Among them are the following: Data at rest encryption using the KMIP protocol is now generally available, enabling you to use this functionality in production environments. Percona Server for MongoDB Docker container now includes the mongodb-tools utility set to align with the upstream container. This enables users to manage backup/restore operations of Percona Server for MongoDB . Fixed security vulnerability CVE-2022-3602 for Percona Distribution for MongoDB 5.0.8 and higher installed from tarballs on Ubuntu 22.04. Updated exit code and status message during the master key rotation improves the user experience while using data-at-rest encryption with KMIP. Detected and resolved table logging inconsistencies for WiredTiger tables at startup Prevented the server from hanging in chunk migration when a step-down occurs. Fixed the issue with incorrect chunk size comparison during split by preventing the AutoSplitVector from using the clientReadable. Fixed the logger deadlock by adding a check against recursive logging Fixed the global time window state before performing the rollback to stable operation by updating the pinned timestamp as part of the transaction setup. Fixed the issue that could lead to data inconsistency by introducing the additional validation of field types for shard key patterns. Users should not modify the type (hashed or range) for the existing shard key fields Fixed the issue with failing resharding operation by introducing the start and end time metrics for resharding recipient Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.1 improvements include the following: The support of server-side encryption with customer-provided keys managed on the customer side (SSE-C) enables you to use the S3-compatible storage of your choice thus preventing the vendor lock-in and saving your costs on AWS KMS (Key Management Service). The ability to configure Percona Backup for MongoDB remotely simplifies its management when Percona Backup for MongoDB is deployed in Docker, Kubernetes or other cloud services. The ability to configure the sidecar mode for Percona Backup for MongoDB improves its operation as part of Kubernetes Operator for MongoDB . Troubleshooting enhancements: * The ability to [define a timezone for logs and to follow the logs dynamically](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/reference/pbm-commands.html#pbm-logs). * Indication of arbiter nodes as non-supported ones in `pbm status` output","title":"Release Highlights"},{"location":"release-notes-v5.0.14.html","text":"Percona Distribution for MongoDB* 5.0.14 (2022-12-08) \u00b6 Release date: December 8, 2022 Installation : Installing Percona Distribution for MongoDB Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a freely available MongoDB database alternative, giving you a single solution that combines enterprise components from the open source community, designed and tested to work together.

Release Highlights \u00b6 With this release, `$backupCursor and $backupCursorExtend aggregation stages is now generally available, enabling you to use it for building custom backup solutions. The bug fixes and improvements provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.14-12 are the following: Fixed the bug where an unexpected behavior could negatively impact existing TTL indexes with improper configuration and could cause the sudden expiration of TTL-indexed documents in a collection. This sudden expiration could cause data to be aged out prior than planned and could negatively impact write performance. This bug involves TTL indexes with the expireAfterSeconds value of NaN (not-a-number). The TTL indexes are treated as 0 instead of NaN and that resulted in the sudden expiration of TTL-indexed documents in a collection. The bug affects MongoDB 5.0.0 through 5.0.13 and MongoDB 6.0.0 through 6.0.1. It could be hit on MongoDB 4.4/4.2 when initially syncing from a 5.0.0-5.0.13 or 6.0.0-6.0.1 node and on MongoDB 5.0.0-5.0.13 when restoring from a mongodump of 4.2 / 4.4 collection or initially syncing from a 4.2/4.4 node that has a TTL configured with expireAfterSeconds: NaN. The issue is fixed upstream in version 5.0.14 and 6.0.2. As the general recommendation, avoid using expireAfterSeconds: NaN as a configuration and correct this config anywhere it exists. Follow closely the upstream recommendations to detect affected indexes and modify them using the collMod command. Corrected a potential race condition where multiple writing threads can update collection metadata in a way where overwrites could possibly happen. This could cause data/documents to be either unavailable or lost. Fixed the issue with how the server handles batches of writes when running $out with secondary read preference by updating write size estimation logic in DocumentSourceWriter Improved the performance of inserts into unique indexes Prevented dropping empty path component from elemMatch path during index selection Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.2 fixes the usability issues for applications operating with it by providing the error messages for the status output in the JSON format.","title":"Percona Distribution for MongoDB* 5.0.14 (2022-12-08)"},{"location":"release-notes-v5.0.14.html#percona-distribution-for-mongodb-5014-2022-12-08","text":"Release date: December 8, 2022 Installation : Installing Percona Distribution for MongoDB Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a freely available MongoDB database alternative, giving you a single solution that combines enterprise components from the open source community, designed and tested to work together.

Please follow closely the upstream recommendations outlined in SERVER-68511 to work around this issue and for the remediation steps, if your cluster is affected. We are pleased to announce the release of the Percona Distribution for MongoDB for the recent major version 5.0.x. Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a freely available MongoDB database alternative, giving you a single solution that combines enterprise components from the open source community, designed and tested to work together. The aim of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is to enable you to run and operate your MongoDB efficiently with the data being consistently backed up. Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes the following components: Percona Server for MongoDB is a fully compatible source-available, drop-in replacement for MongoDB. Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for achieving consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is based on the production release of Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.5-4 and Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.6.1 . Release Highlights \u00b6 This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB. The most notable from them are the following: Added histograms to track latency for tasks scheduled on the reactor thread. Fixed an issue when resharding a collection that could cause data inconsistency (lost writes) due to incorrect actions by the ReshardingCoordinator and attempts to commit anyway. Also could cause fassert() to config server primary. Fixed an issue with stalls on the config server. Updates to config server during resharding may wait too long for oplog slot thus stalling replication on config server indefinitely. Fixed a resharding issue relating to RecipientStateMachine that caused the server to crash Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.6.1 improvements include the following: Improved backup and point-in-time recovery routines alignment by using sequential delete-pitr / install-backup operations instead of in-memory backup intent. This fixes the inability of a backup to start. Added support for automated access to S3 buckets using an EC2 instance profile. When Percona Backup for MongoDB is deployed using an EC2 instance, EC2 environment variables and metadata are used for S3 authentication, saving you from explicitly specifying S3 credentials in the Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration file. This comes handy for architectures deployed using the services like Amazon EC2, kiam, kube2iam or irsa. Extended logging for pbm-agents . This improves user experience with Percona Backup for MongoDB.","title":"Percona Distribution for MongoDB 5.0.5 (2021-12-28)"},{"location":"release-notes-v5.0.5.html#percona-distribution-for-mongodb-505-2021-12-28","text":"Release date: December 28, 2021 Installation : Installing Percona Distribution for MongoDB Warning We don\u2019t recommend this version for the production use due to the critical issue with sharding metadata inconsistency: SERVER-68511 .

Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for achieving consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is based on Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.7-6 and Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.7.0 . Important To make physical backups and restores, the pbm-agent must have the read/write access to the dataDir . If you use the filesystem-based backup storage, the pbm-agent must also have the read/write access to the backup directory. Therefore, starting from version 1.7.0, the user running the pbm-agent is changed from pbm to mongod in Percona Backup for MongoDB packages. To upgrade Percona Backup for MongoDB to version 1.7.0, do the following: Stop the pbm-agent process Upgrade new version packages Reload the systemd process to update the unit file with the following command: $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload If you have a filesystem-based backup storage, grant read/write permissions to the backup directory to the mongod user. Restart the pbm-agent process. If MongoDB runs under a different user than mongod (the default configuration for Percona Server for MongoDB), use the same user to run the pbm-agent . For filesystem-based storage, grant the read/write permissions to the backup directory for this user. Release Highlights \u00b6 This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes the support of Keys Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP). Thus, users can store encryption keys in their favorite KMIP-compatible key manager to set up encryption at rest. This is a tech preview 1 feature. The most notable bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB are the following: Fixed the issue where having a large number of split points causes the chunk splitter to not function correctly and huge chunks would not be split without manual intervention. This can be caused when having small shard key ranges and a very high number of documents and where more than 8192 split points would be needed. Recover the RecoverableCriticalSection service after the initialSync and startupRecovery stages have completed. This prevents a started up shard to miss an in-memory critical section of a resharded collection. Fixed an issue that occurred during the attempt to perform the collation-encoding of a document with a missing sort attribute. In this case an invariant is violated and mongod crashes. Fixed an issue when the rename collection (sharding step) participants can get stuck. Fixed an issue with idle cursors remaining open when the client attempts to run an aggregation with $out or $merge in a transaction on a sharded cluster. Check if the host has cgroups v2 enabled and read the memory limits according to that. Report an error when the WiredTiger version file is empty or missing during a startup. Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.7.0 improvements include the following: Support for physical backups in Percona Server for MongoDB starting from versions 4.2.15-16 and 4.4.6-8 and higher. Physical backups drastically speed up backup and restore performance for large databases (several terabytes). This is a technical preview 1 feature. Oplog replay from the arbitrary start time. This reduces Recovery Point Objective (RPO) when database is recovered from physical or storage-level backups. Ability to configure compression method and level for point-in-time recovery chunks and compression level for backups. Ability to configure the number of S3 multipart upload chunks to comply with various S3-compatible storage provider requirements. Ability to configure the number of upload retries. This facilitates data upload in case of unstable network connection. Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA. They are included in this release so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future GA release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful).

Release Highlights \u00b6 This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes the support of master key rotation for data encrypted using the Keys Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) (tech preview 1 feature). Thus, users can comply with regulatory standards for data security. The most notable bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB are the following: Fixed a bug that causes replication to stall on secondary replica set members in a sharded cluster handling cross-shard transactions. It is caused by WiredTger to erroneously return a write conflict when deciding if an update to a record is allowed. If MongoDB decides to retry the operation that caused the conflict in WiredTiger, it will enter an indefinite retry loop, and oplog application will stall on secondary nodes. If this bug is hit, the secondary nodes will experience indefinite growth in replication lag. Restart the secondary nodes to resume replication. This bug affects MongoDB 4.4.10 through 4.4.13 and 5.0.4 to 5.0.7. Update to the latest version to avoid the secondary replication stall and lag issues. Fixed the issue with a commitQuorum incorrectly allowing non-voting buildIndexes:false nodes to be included in the commitQuorum count. It also fixed an error message relating to data-bearing nodes and quorum regarding to non-voting nodes. Fixed the order of backup blocks returned to the user to match the order retrieved from WiredTiger. Fixed the issue reporting an incorrect number of documents deleted from a capped collection when utilizing a collection scan to perform the delete action.

Thus, users can comply with regulatory standards for data security. The most notable bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB are the following: Fixed a bug that causes replication to stall on secondary replica set members in a sharded cluster handling cross-shard transactions. It is caused by WiredTger to erroneously return a write conflict when deciding if an update to a record is allowed. If MongoDB decides to retry the operation that caused the conflict in WiredTiger, it will enter an indefinite retry loop, and oplog application will stall on secondary nodes. If this bug is hit, the secondary nodes will experience indefinite growth in replication lag. Restart the secondary nodes to resume replication. This bug affects MongoDB 4.4.10 through 4.4.13 and 5.0.4 to 5.0.7. Update to the latest version to avoid the secondary replication stall and lag issues. Fixed the issue with a commitQuorum incorrectly allowing non-voting buildIndexes:false nodes to be included in the commitQuorum count. It also fixed an error message relating to data-bearing nodes and quorum regarding to non-voting nodes. Fixed the order of backup blocks returned to the user to match the order retrieved from WiredTiger. Fixed the issue reporting an incorrect number of documents deleted from a capped collection when utilizing a collection scan to perform the delete action.

Release Highlights \u00b6 This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB provides the following improvements to the data-at-rest encryption using the Keys Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) (tech preview 1 feature): the support of multiple KMIP servers as the failover to your setup the ability to set KMIP client certificate passwords through a flag to simplify the migration from MongoDB Enterprise to Percona Server for MongoDB Added support for Ubuntu 22.04 for Percona Server for MongoDB and Percona Backup for MongoDB . Added improvements to initial syncs from a secondary sync source. The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB and Percona Distribution for MongoDB are the following: Detect namespace changes when refreshing Collection after yielding to maintain data consistency and avoid stale catalogs. Fixed the issue with releasing the critical state too early when sharding an empty collection. This could result in unwanted writes to that collection. Fixed the wrong key/value returning during search near when the key doesn\u2019t exist Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.8.0 improvements include the following: Ability to restore data to a replica set with a different name and configuration . This extends the list of environments compatible for the restore. When you use EBS-snapshots or other tools for physical backups, you no longer have to create a mandatory base backup snapshot in Percona Backup for MongoDB as the starting point for Point-in-Time Recovery oplog slicing . This reduces time and effort on managing excessive backups and makes Point-in-time recovery from physical or storage-level backups more straightforward. The ability to wait for the backup operation to finish before doing further actions through the session lock. This simplifies the automation of operations with Percona Backup for MongoDB . Ability to define backup compression level and method in Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration. To simplify the Percona Backup for MongoDB configuration, the example configuration file is now included in the Percona Backup for MongoDB package.
