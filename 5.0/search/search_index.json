It resulted in the <code>PathCollision</code> error. The issue is fixed by improving dependency analysis for projections by folding dependencies into ancestor dependencies where possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed the deadlock situation in cross shard transactions that could occur when the FCV (Feature Compatibility Version) was set after the \u201cprepared\u201d state of the transactions. That ended up with both the the setFCV thread and the <code>TransactionCoordinator</code> hung.</p> </li> <li> <p>This is a v6.0 backport fix to v5.0 that disables opportunistic read targeting (except for specified hedged reads) in order to prevent possible performance problems associated with uneven read distribution across the secondaries.</p> </li> <li> <p>Backported the check for user errors in case deadline on the migration destination manager is hit while waiting for a range to be cleared up. This prevents the balancer from getting blocked.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed the situation where the shards may skip certain steps in the resharding process but respond to the resharding coordinator as if they had. This can cause the resharding coordinator to continue to wait for updated states in the <code>config.reshardingOperations</code> document on the primary config server and stall indefinitely.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed the potential for the range deleter to wait unnecessarily during concurrent migrations between batches.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed the issue where 2 very different measurements (one in the past and one in future) could be incorrectly included in the same buckettime-series bucket.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resolved potential problem when adding or removing shards and incorrectly gossiping a new topology time without it being majorly committed.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.8.1 improvements include the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Fixed the restore failure on a different cluster.

The issue is fixed by introducing the new approach of handling the metadatada document: it no longer contains the list of backup files which is now stored separately on the storage and is read by PBM on demand.

Whenever a package is updated, the package manager of your operating system detects that and prompts you to update. As long as you update all Distribution packages at the same time, you can ensure that the packages you\u2019re using have been tested and verified by Percona.  We recommend to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Major Release repository Minor Release repository includes a particular minor release of the database and all of the packages that were tested and verified to work with that minor release (for example, <code>pdmdb-5.0.9</code>). You may choose to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Minor Release repository if you have decided to standardize on a particular release which has passed rigorous testing procedures and which has been verified to work with your applications. This allows you to deploy to a new host and ensure that you\u2019ll be using the same version of all the Distribution packages, even if newer releases exist in other repositories. The disadvantage of using a Minor Release repository is that you are locked in this particular release. When potentially critical fixes are released in a later minor version of the database, you will not be prompted for an upgrade by the package manager of your operating system.
