Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.9-10, as part of Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.9, includes the upstream fixes of these bugs.</p> <p>Please upgrade your Percona Distribution for MongoDB to version 4.4.9 as soon as possible.</p> <p>Additional upgrade planning note</p> <p>If you are running MongoDB version 4.4.4 / Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.4 or below, please skip upgrading to version 4.4.8 as that has been found to trigger the Duplicate Key error most consistently. Two WiredTiger bugs (WT-7984 and WT-7995) are found in all versions of MongoDB 4.4.x except 4.4.1. Ideally, upgrade directly from version 4.4.1 to 4.4.9 to attempt to avoid those data impacting or corrupting bugs.</p>"},{"location":"release-notes-v4.4.9.html#release-highlights","title":"Release Highlights","text":"<p>The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB and Percona Distribution for MongoDB are the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>WT-7426 - After upgrade to v4.4.5, startups or restarts can trigger WiredTigers RTS bug which can corrupt page metadata causing documents on affected pages to become invisible to MongoDB. This can lead to temporary query incorrectness or more likely a fatal error and inability to restart . Affects only MongoDB 4.4.5 and Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.5.</p> </li> <li> <p>SERVER-58936 - Unique Index constraint violations possible - can cause duplicate data - fixed in version 4.4.8.</p> </li> <li> <p>WT-7995 - Checkpoint thread can read and persist inconsistent version of data to disk. Can cause Duplicate Key error on startup and prevent the node from starting. Unclean shutdowns can cause data inconsistency within documents, deleted documents to still exist, incomplete query results due to lost or inaccurate index entries, and/or missing documents. Affects MongoDB versions 4.4.2 through 4.4.8 and Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.2 - 4.4.8 as well as MongoDB 5.0.0 through 5.0.2. Upgrade to fixed version of MongoDB 4.4.9 / Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.9 as soon as possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>WT-7984 and associated Server Bug SERVER-60371.</p> </li> <li> <p>WT-7984 - Bug that could cause Checkpoint thread to omit a page of data. If the server experiences an unclean shutdown, an inconsistent checkpoint is used for recovery and causes data corruption. Fixed in version 4.4.9. Requires the validate  command to be run and possible data remediation via complete initial sync.</p> </li> <li> <p>SERVER-60371 - Deployments, previously running version 4.4.8 and upgraded to 4.4.9, could still experience Duplicate Key error and Fatal assertion. Related to the two previous Wired Tiger bugs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Requires the validate  command to be run and possible data remediation via complete initial sync.

Whenever a package is updated, the package manager of your operating system detects that and prompts you to update. As long as you update all Distribution packages at the same time, you can ensure that the packages you\u2019re using have been tested and verified by Percona.  We recommend to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Major Release repository Minor Release repository includes a particular minor release of the database and all of the packages that were tested and verified to work with that minor release (for example, <code>pdmdb-4.4.0</code>). You may choose to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Minor Release repository if you have decided to standardize on a particular release which has passed rigorous testing procedures and which has been verified to work with your applications. This allows you to deploy to a new host and ensure that you\u2019ll be using the same version of all the Distribution packages, even if newer releases exist in other repositories. The disadvantage of using a Minor Release repository is that you are locked in this particular release. When potentially critical fixes are released in a later minor version of the database, you will not be prompted for an upgrade by the package manager of your operating system. You would need to change the configured repository in order to install the upgrade."},{"location":"trademark-policy.html","title":"Trademark policy","text":"<p>This Trademark Policy is to ensure that users of Percona-branded products or services know that what they receive has really been developed, approved, tested and maintained by Percona.
