This is a tech preview feature 1 . Fixed the issue where having a large number of split points causes the chunk splitter to not function correctly and huge chunks would not be split without manual intervention. This can be caused when having small shard key ranges and a very high number of documents and where more than 8192 split points would be needed. Added the repairShardedCollectionChunksHistory command to restore history fields for some chunks. This aims to fix broken snapshot reads and distributed transactions. Fixed incorrect logging of queryHash/planCacheKey for operations that share the same $lookup shape. Added a new startup parameter that skips verifying the table logging settings on restarting as a replica set node from the standalone mode during the restore. This speeds up the restore process. Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA. They are included in this release so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future GA release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful).

Therefore, starting from version 1.7.0, the user running the pbm-agent is changed from pbm to mongod in Percona Backup for MongoDB packages. To upgrade Percona Backup for MongoDB to version 1.7.0, do the following: Stop the pbm-agent process Upgrade new version packages Reload the systemd process to update the unit file with the following command: $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload If you have a filesystem-based backup storage, grant read/write permissions to the backup directory to the mongod user. Restart the pbm-agent process. If MongoDB runs under a different user than mongod (the default configuration for Percona Server for MongoDB), use the same user to run the pbm-agent . For filesystem-based storage, grant the read/write permissions to the backup directory for this user. Release Highlights \u00b6 This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes improvements and bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB. The most notable from them are the following: Support of the master key rotation for data encrypted using the Keys Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) protocol (tech preview feature 1 ). This improvement allows users to comply with regulatory standards for data security. Fixed the issue where having a large number of split points causes the chunk splitter to not function correctly and huge chunks would not be split without manual intervention. This can be caused when having small shard key ranges and a very high number of documents and where more than 8192 split points would be needed. Added the repairShardedCollectionChunksHistory command to restore history fields for some chunks. This aims to fix broken snapshot reads and distributed transactions. Fixed incorrect logging of queryHash/planCacheKey for operations that share the same $lookup shape Added a new startup parameter that skips verifying the table logging settings on restarting as a replica set node from the standalone mode during the restore. This speeds up the restore process. Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.7.0 improvements include the following: Support for physical backups in Percona Server for MongoDB starting from versions 4.2.15-16 and 4.4.6-8 and higher. Physical backups drastically speed up backup and restore performance for large databases (several terabytes). This is a technical preview feature 1 . Oplog replay from the arbitrary start time. This reduces Recovery Point Objective (RPO) when database is recovered from physical or storage-level backups. Ability to configure compression method and level for point-in-time recovery chunks and compression level for backups. Ability to configure the number of S3 multipart upload chunks to comply with various S3-compatible storage provider requirements. Ability to configure the number of upload retries. This facilitates data upload in case of unstable network connection. Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA. They are included in this release so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future GA release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful). This functionality can change (APIs, CLIs, etc.) from tech preview to GA. \u21a9 \u21a9","title":"Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.14 (2022-05-25)"},{"location":"release-notes-v4.4.14.html#percona-distribution-for-mongodb-4414-2022-05-25","text":"Release date May 25, 2022 Installation Install Percona Distribution for MongoDB Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a freely available MongoDB database alternative, giving you a single solution that combines enterprise components from the open source community, designed and tested to work together.

This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is based on Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.9-10 and Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.6.0 . Warning Beginning with MongoDB 4.4.2, several data impacting or corrupting bugs were introduced. Find the details below. These bugs are fixed in MongoDB 4.4.9. Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.9-10, as part of Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.9, includes the upstream fixes of these bugs. Please upgrade your Percona Distribution for MongoDB to version 4.4.9 as soon as possible. Additional upgrade planning note If you are running MongoDB version 4.4.4 / Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.4 or below, please skip upgrading to version 4.4.8 as that has been found to trigger the Duplicate Key error most consistently. Two WiredTiger bugs ( WT-7984 and WT-7995 ) are found in all versions of MongoDB 4.4.x except 4.4.1. Ideally, upgrade directly from version 4.4.1 to 4.4.9 to attempt to avoid those data impacting or corrupting bugs. Release Highlights \u00b6 The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB and Percona Distribution for MongoDB are the following: WT-7426 - After upgrade to v4.4.5, startups or restarts can trigger WiredTigers RTS bug which can corrupt page metadata causing documents on affected pages to become invisible to MongoDB. This can lead to temporary query incorrectness or more likely a fatal error and inability to restart . Affects only MongoDB 4.4.5 and Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.5. SERVER-58936 - Unique Index constraint violations possible - can cause duplicate data - fixed in version 4.4.8. WT-7995 - Checkpoint thread can read and persist inconsistent version of data to disk. Can cause Duplicate Key error on startup and prevent the node from starting. Unclean shutdowns can cause data inconsistency within documents, deleted documents to still exist, incomplete query results due to lost or inaccurate index entries, and/or missing documents. Affects MongoDB versions 4.4.2 through 4.4.8 and Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.2 - 4.4.8 as well as MongoDB 5.0.0 through 5.0.2. Upgrade to fixed version of MongoDB 4.4.9 / Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.9 as soon as possible. WT-7984 and associated Server Bug SERVER-60371. WT-7984 - Bug that could cause Checkpoint thread to omit a page of data. If the server experiences an unclean shutdown, an inconsistent checkpoint is used for recovery and causes data corruption. Fixed in version 4.4.9. Requires the validate command to be run and possible data remediation via complete initial sync. SERVER-60371 - Deployments, previously running version 4.4.8 and upgraded to 4.4.9, could still experience Duplicate Key error and Fatal assertion. Related to the two previous Wired Tiger bugs. Requires the validate command to be run and possible data remediation via complete initial sync. Currently under review. Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.6.0 improvements include the following: Support for Percona Server for MongoDB and MongoDB Community 5.0 Point-in-time recovery enhancements: ability to restore from any previous snapshot and configurable span of oplog events JSON output for PBM commands to simplify interfacing PBM with applications","title":"Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.9 (2021-10-07)"},{"location":"release-notes-v4.4.9.html#percona-distribution-for-mongodb-449-2021-10-07","text":"Release date October 7, 2021 Installation Install Percona Distribution for MongoDB Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a freely available MongoDB database alternative, giving you a single solution that combines enterprise components from the open source community, designed and tested to work together.
