Clustered collections don\u2019t require secondary indexes and thus, result in faster queries. A single read/write for the index and the document improves performance for inserts, updates, deletes and queries. With less storage space required by clustered connections, bulk updates and inserts are performed faster. And by turning clustered indexes to TTL indexes with a single field, you benefit from simplified delete operations and reduced storage costs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.x improvements are the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Physical backups and restores are now generally available. This enables you to use them in production environments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data-at-rest encryption is supported for physical backups and restores. This enables you to comply to data security regulations and save time on operating with large data sets.</p> </li> <li> <p>By tracking physical restore progress, you have a clear picture of your restore operations and can timely react to any changes or issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>Logical backups and restores can now be done selectively. This is a tech preview <sup>1</sup> feature yet it enables you to work only with the desired subset of data and thereby save time on database maintenance and costs on storage.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.2 fixes the usability issues for applications operating with Percona Backup for MongoDB by providing the error messages for the status output in the JSON format.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA. They are included in this release so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future GA release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful).

As long as you update all Distribution packages at the same time, you can ensure that the packages you\u2019re using have been tested and verified by Percona.  We recommend to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Major Release repository Minor Release repository includes a particular minor release of the database and all of the packages that were tested and verified to work with that minor release (for example, <code>pdmdb-6.0.2</code>). You may choose to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Minor Release repository if you have decided to standardize on a particular release which has passed rigorous testing procedures and which has been verified to work with your applications. This allows you to deploy to a new host and ensure that you\u2019ll be using the same version of all the Distribution packages, even if newer releases exist in other repositories. The disadvantage of using a Minor Release repository is that you are locked in this particular release. When potentially critical fixes are released in a later minor version of the database, you will not be prompted for an upgrade by the package manager of your operating system. You would need to change the configured repository in order to install the upgrade."},{"location":"repo-overview.html#get-expert-help","title":"Get expert help","text":"<p>If you need assistance, visit the community forum for comprehensive and free database knowledge, or contact our Percona Database Experts for professional support and services.</p> <p> Community Forum  Get a Percona Expert</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"trademark-policy.html","title":"Trademark Policy","text":"<p>This Trademark Policy is to ensure that users of Percona-branded products or services know that what they receive has really been developed, approved, tested and maintained by Percona.
