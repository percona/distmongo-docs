Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a freely available MongoDB database alternative, giving you a single solution that combines enterprise components from the open source community, designed and tested to work together. The aim of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is to enable you to run and operate your MongoDB efficiently with the data being consistently backed up. Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes the following components: Percona Server for MongoDB is a fully compatible source-available, drop-in replacement for MongoDB. Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for achieving consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is based on the production release of Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.2-1 and Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.2 . Release Highlights \u00b6 Data-at-rest encryption using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) is generally available enabling you to use it in your production environment $backupCursor and $backupCursorExtended functionality is generally available, enabling your application developers to use it for building custom backup solutions. Note Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes Percona Backup for MongoDB - the open source tool for consistent backups and restores in MongoDB sharded clusters. Percona Server for MongoDB packages now include mongosh instead of mongo CLI. If you install Percona Server for MongoDB from tarballs , you must install mongosh from a separate tarball. Fixed security vulnerability CVE-2022-3602 for Percona Distribution for MongoDB installed from tarballs on Ubuntu 22.04. Percona Distribution for MongoDB 6.0.2 includes all the features of MongoDB 6.0.2 Community Edition, among which are the following: Enhanced time series collections enable you to: Get deeper data analysis insights by building compound and secondary indexes on time, metadata and measurement fields. Distribute the load among nodes in the cluster by sharding new and existing time series collections . Benefit from faster reads and improved performance by applying the sorting on the most recent entry instead of the whole collection. The following change streams optimizations help you enhance your event-driven solutions: Improve in-app notifications, reference deleted documents or feed the updated version of the entire doc to the downstream system using the before and after states of a document that was changed . React not only to data changes but also to database change events like creating or dropping of collections with the Data Definition Language (DDL) support. New aggregation stages like $densify , $documents , $fill and operators like $bottom , $firstN , $lastN , $maxN / $minN and others enable you to off load work from your developers to the database. These operators allow automating key commands, getting required data insights by combining individual operators into aggregation pipelines. As a result, your developers spend less time on writing complex code or manipulating data manually and can focus on other activities. Cluster-wide configuration parameters and commands save your DBAs\u2019 time on cluster administration. The Stable API (formerly known as versioned API) features the extended set of new database commands and aggregation operators which enables you to improve communication of your apps and MongoDB. Speed up data processing and save on storage costs with clustered collections . Clustered collections don\u2019t require secondary indexes and thus, result in faster queries. A single read/write for the index and the document improves performance for inserts, updates, deletes and queries. With less storage space required by clustered connections, bulk updates and inserts are performed faster. And by turning clustered indexes to TTL indexes with a single field, you benefit from simplified delete operations and reduced storage costs. Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.x improvements are the following: Physical backups and restores are now generally available. This enables you to use them in production environments. Data-at-rest encryption is supported for physical backups and restores. This enables you to comply to data security regulations and save time on operating with large data sets. By tracking physical restore progress , you have a clear picture of your restore operations and can timely react to any changes or issues. Logical backups and restores can now be done selectively . This is a tech preview 1 feature yet it enables you to work only with the desired subset of data and thereby save time on database maintenance and costs on storage. Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.2 fixes the usability issues for applications operating with Percona Backup for MongoDB by providing the error messages for the status output in the JSON format. Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA. They are included in this release so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future GA release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful).

Bug fixes and improvements introduced in MongoDB and included in Percona Distribution for MongoDB are the following: Fixed a hang when inserting or deleting a document with large number of index entries Fixed the issue with filtering time-series collections that contain the date values earlier than Unix epoch (1970) Fixed the issue with adding a new unencrypted node into an encrypted replica set by removing options which might not apply for this node. Changed the default log verbosity level for _killOperations to D2. Fixed deadlock that can occur during index creation Resolved the issue with the sort order on clustered collections where requested decreasing order returned returned results in increasing order Fixed the issue with indexes reported as valid while being inconsistent by improving the validation of those indexes Fixed the migration of distributed transactions by registering the migration source operation observer hook in all paths where transactions transition into the prepared state. Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.5 introduces the fixes: for the physical restore process for deployments where the mongod --dbpath option has a forward slash (\u2018/\u2019) as the last char for security vulnerability CVE-2022-41723 by updating the Golang library dependencies to the latest versions","title":"Percona Distribution for MongoDB 6.0.5 (2023-03-29)"},{"location":"release-notes-v6.0.5.html#percona-distribution-for-mongodb-605-2023-03-29","text":"Release date: March 29, 2023 Installation : Installing Percona Distribution for MongoDB Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a freely available MongoDB database alternative, giving you a single solution that combines enterprise components from the open source community, designed and tested to work together.

Note that due to the changes in metadata files required for the restore, backups made with previous PBM versions are incompatible for the restore with PBM 2.1.0. Selective backup and restore of sharded collections improves the management of a desired subset of data in sharded clusters and saves you extra costs on data storage and transfer. This is the tech preview feature due to some known limitations . The support of parallel download of data chunks from the S3 storage improves the physical restore performance up to 7.5 times.
