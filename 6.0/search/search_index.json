Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a freely available MongoDB database alternative, giving you a single solution that combines enterprise components from the open source community, designed and tested to work together. The aim of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is to enable you to run and operate your MongoDB efficiently with the data being consistently backed up. Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes the following components: Percona Server for MongoDB is a fully compatible source-available, drop-in replacement for MongoDB. Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for achieving consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is based on the production release of Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.2-1 and Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.2 . Release Highlights \u00b6 Data-at-rest encryption using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) is generally available enabling you to use it in your production environment $backupCursor and $backupCursorExtended functionality is generally available, enabling your application developers to use it for building custom backup solutions. Note Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes Percona Backup for MongoDB - the open source tool for consistent backups and restores in MongoDB sharded clusters. Percona Server for MongoDB packages now include mongosh instead of mongo CLI. If you install Percona Server for MongoDB from tarballs , you must install mongosh from a separate tarball. Fixed security vulnerability CVE-2022-3602 for Percona Distribution for MongoDB installed from tarballs on Ubuntu 22.04. Percona Distribution for MongoDB 6.0.2 includes all the features of MongoDB 6.0.2 Community Edition, among which are the following: Enhanced time series collections enable you to: Get deeper data analysis insights by building compound and secondary indexes on time, metadata and measurement fields. Distribute the load among nodes in the cluster by sharding new and existing time series collections . Benefit from faster reads and improved performance by applying the sorting on the most recent entry instead of the whole collection. The following change streams optimizations help you enhance your event-driven solutions: Improve in-app notifications, reference deleted documents or feed the updated version of the entire doc to the downstream system using the before and after states of a document that was changed . React not only to data changes but also to database change events like creating or dropping of collections with the Data Definition Language (DDL) support. New aggregation stages like $densify , $documents , $fill and operators like $bottom , $firstN , $lastN , $maxN / $minN and others enable you to off load work from your developers to the database. These operators allow automating key commands, getting required data insights by combining individual operators into aggregation pipelines. As a result, your developers spend less time on writing complex code or manipulating data manually and can focus on other activities. Cluster-wide configuration parameters and commands save your DBAs\u2019 time on cluster administration. The Stable API (formerly known as versioned API) features the extended set of new database commands and aggregation operators which enables you to improve communication of your apps and MongoDB. Speed up data processing and save on storage costs with clustered collections . Clustered collections don\u2019t require secondary indexes and thus, result in faster queries. A single read/write for the index and the document improves performance for inserts, updates, deletes and queries. With less storage space required by clustered connections, bulk updates and inserts are performed faster. And by turning clustered indexes to TTL indexes with a single field, you benefit from simplified delete operations and reduced storage costs. Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.x improvements are the following: Physical backups and restores are now generally available. This enables you to use them in production environments. Data-at-rest encryption is supported for physical backups and restores. This enables you to comply to data security regulations and save time on operating with large data sets. By tracking physical restore progress , you have a clear picture of your restore operations and can timely react to any changes or issues. Logical backups and restores can now be done selectively . This is a tech preview 1 feature yet it enables you to work only with the desired subset of data and thereby save time on database maintenance and costs on storage. Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.2 fixes the usability issues for applications operating with Percona Backup for MongoDB by providing the error messages for the status output in the JSON format. Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA. They are included in this release so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future GA release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful).

However, it is acceptable to omit the word \u201cPercona\u201d for brevity on the second and subsequent uses, where such omission does not cause confusion.

Trademarks help to prevent confusion in the marketplace, by distinguishing one company\u2019s or person\u2019s products and services from another\u2019s. Percona owns a number of marks, including but not limited to Percona, XtraDB, Percona XtraDB, XtraBackup, Percona XtraBackup, Percona Server, and Percona Live, plus the distinctive visual icons and logos associated with these marks. Both the unregistered and registered marks of Percona are protected. Use of any Percona trademark in the name, URL, or other identifying characteristic of any product, service, website, or other use is not permitted without Percona\u2019s written permission with the following three limited exceptions. First , you may use the appropriate Percona mark when making a nominative fair use reference to a bona fide Percona product. Second , when Percona has released a product under a version of the GNU General Public License (\u201cGPL\u201d), you may use the appropriate Percona mark when distributing a verbatim copy of that product in accordance with the terms and conditions of the GPL. Third , you may use the appropriate Percona mark to refer to a distribution of GPL-released Percona software that has been modified with minor changes for the sole purpose of allowing the software to operate on an operating system or hardware platform for which Percona has not yet released the software, provided that those third party changes do not affect the behavior, functionality, features, design or performance of the software. Users who acquire this Percona-branded software receive substantially exact implementations of the Percona software. Percona reserves the right to revoke this authorization at any time in its sole discretion. For example, if Percona believes that your modification is beyond the scope of the limited license granted in this Policy or that your use of the Percona mark is detrimental to Percona, Percona will revoke this authorization. Upon revocation, you must immediately cease using the applicable Percona mark. If you do not immediately cease using the Percona mark upon revocation, Percona may take action to protect its rights and interests in the Percona mark. Percona does not grant any license to use any Percona mark for any other modified versions of Percona software; such use will require our prior written permission. Neither trademark law nor any of the exceptions set forth in this Trademark Policy permit you to truncate, modify or otherwise use any Percona mark as part of your own brand. For example, if XYZ creates a modified version of the Percona Server, XYZ may not brand that modification as \u201cXYZ Percona Server\u201d or \u201cPercona XYZ Server\u201d, even if that modification otherwise complies with the third exception noted above. In all cases, you must comply with applicable law, the underlying license, and this Trademark Policy, as amended from time to time. For instance, any mention of Percona trademarks should include the full trademarked name, with proper spelling and capitalization, along with attribution of ownership to Percona Inc. For example, the full proper name for XtraBackup is Percona XtraBackup. However, it is acceptable to omit the word \u201cPercona\u201d for brevity on the second and subsequent uses, where such omission does not cause confusion.
