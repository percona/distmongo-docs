We recommend to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Major Release repository Minor Release repository includes a particular minor release of the database and all of the packages that were tested and verified to work with that minor release (for example, <code>pdmdb-6.0.3</code>). You may choose to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Minor Release repository if you have decided to standardize on a particular release which has passed rigorous testing procedures and which has been verified to work with your applications. This allows you to deploy to a new host and ensure that you\u2019ll be using the same version of all the Distribution packages, even if newer releases exist in other repositories. The disadvantage of using a Minor Release repository is that you are locked in this particular release. When potentially critical fixes are released in a later minor version of the database, you will not be prompted for an upgrade by the package manager of your operating system.
