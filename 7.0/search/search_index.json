It was caused by the backup metadata document reaching the maximum size limit of 16MB. The issue is fixed by introducing the new approach of handling the metadatada document: it no longer contains the list of backup files which is now stored separately on the storage and is read by PBM on demand. The new metadata handling approach applies to physical, incremental and shapshot-based backups.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"release-notes-v7.0.8.html#get-expert-help","title":"Get expert help","text":"<p>If you need assistance, visit the community forum for comprehensive and free database knowledge, or contact our Percona Database Experts for professional support and services.</p> <p> Community Forum  Get a Percona Expert</p>"},{"location":"release-notes.html","title":"Percona Distribution for MongoDB release notes","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Percona Distribution for MongoDB 7.0.11 (2024-06-03)</p> </li> <li> <p>Percona Distribution for MongoDB 7.0.8 (2024-04-24)</p> </li> <li> <p>Percona Distribution for MongoDB 7.0.7 (2024-04-04)</p> </li> <li> <p>Percona Distribution for MongoDB 7.0.5 (2024-01-23)</p> </li> <li> <p>Percona Distribution for MongoDB 7.0.4 (2023-12-11)</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"release-notes.html#get-expert-help","title":"Get expert help","text":"<p>If you need assistance, visit the community forum for comprehensive and free database knowledge, or contact our Percona Database Experts for professional support and services.</p> <p> Community Forum  Get a Percona Expert</p>"},{"location":"repo-overview.html","title":"Repository overview","text":"<p>Percona provides two repositories for Percona Distribution for MongoDB:</p> Major release repository Minor release repository Major Release repository (for example, <code>pdmdb-7.0</code>) includes the latest version packages. Whenever a package is updated, the package manager of your operating system detects that and prompts you to update. As long as you update all Distribution packages at the same time, you can ensure that the packages you\u2019re using have been tested and verified by Percona.  We recommend to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Major Release repository Minor Release repository includes a particular minor release of the database and all of the packages that were tested and verified to work with that minor release (for example, <code>pdmdb-6.0.3</code>). You may choose to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Minor Release repository if you have decided to standardize on a particular release which has passed rigorous testing procedures and which has been verified to work with your applications. This allows you to deploy to a new host and ensure that you\u2019ll be using the same version of all the Distribution packages, even if newer releases exist in other repositories. The disadvantage of using a Minor Release repository is that you are locked in this particular release. When potentially critical fixes are released in a later minor version of the database, you will not be prompted for an upgrade by the package manager of your operating system. You would need to change the configured repository in order to install the upgrade."},{"location":"repo-overview.html#get-expert-help","title":"Get expert help","text":"<p>If you need assistance, visit the community forum for comprehensive and free database knowledge, or contact our Percona Database Experts for professional support and services.</p> <p> Community Forum  Get a Percona Expert</p>"},{"location":"trademark-policy.html","title":"Trademark Policy","text":"<p>This Trademark Policy is to ensure that users of Percona-branded products or services know that what they receive has really been developed, approved, tested and maintained by Percona.
