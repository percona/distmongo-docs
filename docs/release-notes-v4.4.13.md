| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| **Installation** | [Install Percona Distribution for MongoDB](installation.md)|

Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a freely available MongoDB database alternative, giving you a single solution that combines enterprise components from the open source community, designed and tested to work together. The aim of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is to enable you to run and operate your
MongoDB efficiently with the data being consistently backed up.

Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes the following components:

* *Percona Server for MongoDB* is a fully compatible source-available, drop-in replacement
for MongoDB.

* *Percona Backup for MongoDB* is a distributed, low-impact solution for achieving
consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets.

This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is based on [Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.13-13](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/4.4/release_notes/4.4.13-13.html) and [Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.6.1](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/release-notes/1.6.1.html).

!!! warning

    Inconsistent data is observed after the upgrade from MongoDB 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 to versions 4.4.8+ and 5.0.2+.
    This issue is fixed upstream in versions 4.4.11+ and 5.0.6+.

    Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4.12 and higher, as part of Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.4.12 and higher, includes the upstream fixes of these bugs.

    Please [upgrade](minor-upgrade.md#minor-upgrade) your Percona Distribution for MongoDB to version 4.4.12+ as soon as possible.

## Release Highlights

This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes improvements and bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB. The most notable from  them are the following:

* Added support for [Keys Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/4.4/kmip.html) so that users can store encryption keys in their favorite KMIP-compatible key manager to set up encryption at rest. This is a tech preview feature [^1].

* Fixed the issue where having a large number of split points causes the chunk splitter to not function correctly and huge chunks would not be split without manual intervention. This can be caused when having small shard key ranges and a very high number of documents and where more than 8192 split points would be needed.

* Added the `repairShardedCollectionChunksHistory` command to restore history fields for some chunks. This aims to fix broken snapshot reads and distributed transactions.

* Fixed incorrect logging of queryHash/planCacheKey for operations that share the same `$lookup` shape.

* Added a new startup parameter that skips verifying the table logging settings on restarting as a replica set node from the standalone mode during the restore. This speeds up the restore process.

[^1]: Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA. They are included in this release so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future GA release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful). This functionality can change (APIs, CLIs, etc.) from tech preview to GA.
