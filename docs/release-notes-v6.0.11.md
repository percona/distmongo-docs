[Installation](installation.md){.md-button}


Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a freely available MongoDB database alternative, giving you a single solution that combines enterprise components from the open source community, designed and tested to work together. The aim of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is to enable you to run and operate your
MongoDB efficiently with the data being consistently backed up.


Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes the following components:

* *Percona Server for MongoDB* is a fully compatible source-available, drop-in replacement
for MongoDB.

* *Percona Backup for MongoDB* is a distributed, low-impact solution for achieving
consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets.

This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is based on the production release of [Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.11-8](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/6.0/release_notes/6.0.11-8.html) and [Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.3.0](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/release-notes/2.3.0.html).

## Release Highlights

Bug fixes and improvements introduced in MongoDB and included in Percona Distribution for MongoDB are the following:

* Added the ability to configure the retry behavior for Percona Server for MongoDB to connect to the KMIP server when using [data-at-rest encryption](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/6.0/kmip.html)
* Improved performance of updating the routing table and prevented blocking client requests during refresh for clusters with 1 million of chunks.
* Removed the `operationBlockedByRefresh` metric from the `serverStatus` command output.
* Fixed incorrect results when `$project` is followed by `$group` and the group doesnâ€™t require full document
* Made Resharding Operation Resilient to NetworkInterfaceExceededTimeLimit
* Collected the Feature Compatibility Version (FCV) in Full Time Diagnostic Data Capture (FTDC) to simplify diagnostics.
* Fixed the issue with the `$merge` operation failing when used in sharding clusters with the read concern set to "majority".
* Introduced `vectorSearch` aggregation stage
* Fixed the conversion form string to doubleValue to not lose precision and be able to rountrip and retrieve the same value back.

Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.3.0 enhancements include the following:

* The support for MongoDB 4.2 is deprecated. Existing functionality in Percona Backup for MongoDB remains compatible with MongoDB 4.2 and Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2; however, further enhancements and bug fixes are no longer tested against this version.
* The ability to [view the backup contents](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/usage/describe-backup.html) improves troubleshooting of backups in environments where databases are often created and / or dropped. 
* The ability to [make physical backups in mixed deployments](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/features/physical.html#physical-backups-in-mixed-deployments) with MongoDB Community and Percona Server for MongoDB (PSMDB) nodes streamlines the backup flow for organizations that are still evaluating or migrating their data sets against PSMDB.
* Improved validation of a base backup snapshot for point-in-time recovery aligns the recovery flow for logical and physical backups.
