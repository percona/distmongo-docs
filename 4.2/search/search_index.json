Release Highlights \u00b6 The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.19-19 and Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.2.19 are the following: Support of Keys Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP). Thus, users can store encryption keys in their favorite KMIP-compatible key manager to set up encryption at rest. This is a tech preview feature 1 . Added the repairShardedCollectionChunksHistory command to restore history fields for some chunks. This aims to fix broken snapshot reads and distributed transactions. Fixed an issue with transaction coordinator crashing if the transaction is aborted when attempting to commit a transaction. Fixed the issue with the distributed transactions being in the prolonged prepared state that was caused by the blocking of acquiring the WiredTiger write tickets by the transaction coordinator. Fixed an issue with an empty array for the $nin statement. Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA. They are included in this release so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future GA release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful). This functionality can change (APIs, CLIs, etc.) from tech preview to GA. \u21a9","title":"Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.2.19 (2022-03-29)"},{"location":"release-notes-v4.2.19.html#percona-distribution-for-mongodb-4219-2022-03-29","text":"Release date March 29, 2022 Installation Install Percona Distribution for MongoDB Percona Distribution for MongoDB is a collection of solutions to run and operate your MongoDB efficiently with the data being consistently backed up.

Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes the following components: Percona Server for MongoDB is a fully compatible source-available, drop-in replacement for MongoDB. Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for achieving consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is based on Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.20-20 and Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.7.0 . Important To make physical backups and restores, the pbm-agent must have the read/write access to the dataDir . If you use the filesystem-based backup storage, the pbm-agent must also have the read/write access to the backup directory. Therefore, starting from version 1.7.0, the user running the pbm-agent is changed from pbm to mongod in Percona Backup for MongoDB packages. To upgrade Percona Backup for MongoDB to version 1.7.0, do the following: Stop the pbm-agent process Upgrade new version packages Reload the systemd process to update the unit file with the following command: $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload If you have a filesystem-based backup storage, grant read/write permissions to the backup directory to the mongod user. Restart the pbm-agent process. If MongoDB runs under a different user than mongod (the default configuration for Percona Server for MongoDB), use the same user to run the pbm-agent . For filesystem-based storage, grant the read/write permissions to the backup directory for this user. Release Highlights \u00b6 The bug fixes, provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.20-20 and Percona Distribution for MongoDB 4.2.20 are the following: Support of the master key rotation for data encrypted using the Keys Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) protocol (tech preview feature 1 ). This improvement allows users to comply with regulatory standards for data security. Abort the WiredTiger transaction after releasing Client lock to avoid deadlocks. Check if the host has cgroups v2 enabled and read the memory limits according to that. Return the shutdown error as the top level error when batch writing command fails due to mongos shutdown. Fixed the double free state for the DocumentSource::optimizeAt() pipeline by making sure all pointers are in place before disposing the pipeline prefix. Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.7.0 improvements include the following: Support for physical backups in Percona Server for MongoDB starting from versions 4.2.15-16 and 4.4.6-8 and higher. Physical backups drastically speed up backup and restore performance for large databases (several terabytes). This is a technical preview feature 1 . Oplog replay from the arbitrary start time. This reduces Recovery Point Objective (RPO) when database is recovered from physical or storage-level backups. Ability to configure compression method and level for point-in-time recovery chunks and compression level for backups. Ability to configure the number of S3 multipart upload chunks to comply with various S3-compatible storage provider requirements. Ability to configure the number of upload retries. This facilitates data upload in case of unstable network connection. Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA.

This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB is based on Percona Server for MongoDB 4.2.22-22 and Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.8.1 . Release Highlights \u00b6 Important With this release, the kmipKeyIdentifier option for data-at-rest encryption using the KMIP protocol (tech preview feature 1 ) is optional. This change serves to improve the user experience with Percona Server for MongoDB as the option names and behavior are similar to those of MongoDB Enterprise. However, if data-at-rest encryption using KMIP is configured, it is the breaking change because the standard upgrade procedure does not work. We do recommend to use the data-at-rest encryption using the KMIP protocol only for testing purposes until it is in the general availability stage. If you have configured data at rest encryption and it is absolutely necessary to upgrade your MongoDB instance, see the upgrade instructions . This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes bug fixes and improvements provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB and Percona Distribution for MongoDB. Among them are the following: Fixed an issue that occurred during the attempt to perform the collation-encoding of a document with a missing sort attribute. In this case an invariant is violated and mongod crashes. Fixed the TTLMonitor behavior to skip processing TTL indexes if the expireAfterSeconds option value is NaN (Not a Number). Changed the behavior of the ShardingTaskExecutorPoolSize parameter to control the connection pool size for config server replica set and shard nodes separately. Fixed the issue with bad projection created during dependency analysis due to string order assumption. It resulted in the PathCollision error. The issue is fixed by improving dependency analysis for projections by folding dependencies into ancestor dependencies where possible. Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.8.1 improvements include the following: Fixed the restore failure on a different cluster. Now the UUID of users and system collections are not preserved when replaying the oplog.

Release Highlights \u00b6 Optimized the construction of the balancer\u2019s collection distribution status histogram Fixed the query planner logic to distinguish parameterized queries in the presence of a partial index that contains logical expressions ( $and , $or ). Improved performance of updating the routing table and prevented blocking client requests during refresh for clusters with 1 million of chunks. Avoided traversing routing table in balancer split chunk policy Fixed the issue that caused the modification of the original ChunkMap vector during the chunk migration and that could lead to data loss. The issue affects MongoDB versions 4.4.25, 5.0.21, 6.0.10 through 6.0.11 and 7.0.1 through 7.0.2. Requires stopping all chunk merge activities and restarting all the binaries in the cluster (both mongod and mongos ). Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.4 provides the ability to specify the custom path to mongod binaries to simplify the physical restore process.
