This change serves to improve the user experience with Percona Server for MongoDB as the option names and behavior are similar to those of MongoDB Enterprise. However, if data-at-rest encryption using KMIP is configured, it is the breaking change because the standard upgrade procedure does not work. We do recommend to use the data-at-rest encryption using the KMIP protocol only for testing purposes until it is in the general availability stage.</p> <p>If you have configured data at rest encryption and it is absolutely necessary to upgrade your MongoDB instance, see the upgrade instructions.</p>  <p>This release of Percona Distribution for MongoDB includes bug fixes and improvements provided by MongoDB and included in Percona Server for MongoDB and Percona Distribution for MongoDB. Among them are the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Fixed an issue that occurred during the attempt to perform the collation-encoding of a document with a missing sort attribute. In this case an invariant is violated and <code>mongod</code> crashes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed the TTLMonitor behavior to skip processing TTL indexes if the expireAfterSeconds option value is NaN (Not a Number).</p> </li> <li> <p>Changed the behavior of the ShardingTaskExecutorPoolSize parameter to control the connection pool size for config server replica set and shard nodes separately.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed the issue with bad projection created during dependency analysis due to string order assumption. It resulted in the <code>PathCollision</code> error. The issue is fixed by improving dependency analysis for projections by folding dependencies into ancestor dependencies where possible.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Percona Backup for MongoDB 1.8.1 improvements include the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Fixed the restore failure on a different cluster. Now the UUID of users and system collections are not preserved when replaying the oplog.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Point-in-Time recovery chunks display is now consistent in both <code>pbm status</code> and <code>pbm list</code> outputs</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"release-notes-v4.2.22.html#packaging-notes","title":"Packaging Notes","text":"<p>Debian 9 (\u201cStretch\u201d) is no longer supported.</p>   <ol> <li> <p>Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA.

MongoDB:</p>    Major release repository Minor release repository     Major Release repository (for example, <code>pdmdb-4.2</code>) includes the latest version packages. Whenever a package is updated, the package manager of your operating system detects that and prompts you to update. As long as you update all Distribution packages at the same time, you can ensure that the packages you\u2019re using have been tested and verified by Percona.  We recommend to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Major Release repository Minor Release repository includes a particular minor release of the database and all of the packages that were tested and verified to work with that minor release (for example, <code>pdmdb-4.2.20</code>). You may choose to install Percona Distribution for MongoDB from the Minor Release repository if you have decided to standardize on a particular release which has passed rigorous testing procedures and which has been verified to work with your applications. This allows you to deploy to a new host and ensure that you\u2019ll be using the same version of all the Distribution packages, even if newer releases exist in other repositories. The disadvantage of using a Minor Release repository is that you are locked in this particular release. When potentially critical fixes are released in a later minor version of the database, you will not be prompted for an upgrade by the package manager of your operating system. You would need to change the configured repository in order to install the upgrade."},{"location":"trademark-policy.html","title":"Trademark Policy","text":"<p>This Trademark Policy is to ensure that users of Percona-branded products or services know that what they receive has really been developed, approved, tested and maintained by Percona.
